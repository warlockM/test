              The School Mental Health Initiative is a comprehensive online
              platform designed to help schools, educators, and parents support
              the mental health of students. Our goal is to provide school-based
              mental health resources, tools, and best practices to ensure that
              all students have access to the support they need. Additionally, our
              website provides resources for educators to better understand mental
              health issues, as well as strategies to help support their studentsâ€™
              emotional wellbeing.
