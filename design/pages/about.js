            The School Mental Health Initiative is a comprehensive online
            platform designed to help schools, educators, and parents support
            the mental health of students. Our goal is to provide school-based
            mental health resources, tools, and best practices to ensure that
            all students have access to the support they need. Additionally, our
            website provides resources for educators to better understand mental
            health issues, as well as strategies to help support their studentsâ€™
            emotional wellbeing.
